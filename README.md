This website is powered by [RMarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/rmarkdown_websites.html) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
Although I have been working with the R programming language since 2014, I only just discovered RMarkdown and am using this website
to explore its potential, especially for humanities data and non-textual digital media analysis. I am also trying to be better about
using GitHub as version control for projects.
