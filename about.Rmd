title: "About RHumans"

My name is [Carolyn](http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8221-0519). I had the awesome opportunity to take a "play" approach to learning and working while at Florida State's office of Digital Resarch and Scholarship. I got to work on neat R projects with brilliant people like [Sarah Stanley](https://twitter.com/sarcathtic), and developed the almost perverse impulse to ask myself "Okay, but can I do that in R?"  

I try to make myself useful. I now live in Dutchess County, NY, and there is a lot of good work that will keep making this a better place to live. Passionate, intelligent people are doing that work right now.  

Okay, but can we do it in R?
