# Intro to RMarkdown
Percolator session by Carolyn Moritz  
*2017/03/01*

The following begins with a handy reference provided by RStudio. To create the basis of demonstration as an independent RMarkdown document: **File** -> **New File** -> **R Markdown...**  
Additions resulting from the Percolator session will be indicated below in <span style="color:green">green</span>.

### Initial Setup
To follow along on your own machine, first install [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/).  
In the RStudio console, install the RMarkdown package and call the library: 
<br><br>
`install.packages("rmarkdown")`  
`library(rmarkdown)`

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

### RMarkdown

This is an RMarkdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

### Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

### <span style="color:green">Demonstration: Pushing to Site</span>

<span style="color:green">Participants curious about this website setup are encouraged to visit [Like this setup?](setup.html) for notes on the resources I used. </span> 

<span style="color:green">Pushing new content to the live site consists of three steps: **Knit**, **Commit**, and **Push**.  </span>

<span style="color:green">Selecting **Knit HTML** ![](images/knit.png)  in the console opens a live preview window. If I had an RPub account synced to this console, I could select **Publish** ![](images/publish.png) and automatically send the generated HTML document to an RPub website. My configuration, however, requires two quick additional steps.</span>  

<span style="color:green">We **commit** changes in the Version Control dropdown menu:</span>      
![](images/versiondropdown.png)  

<span style="color:green">The left pane displays files that have been changed. Now we select **Staged** for all of them and add a useful commit message. We select **Commit**, close the confirmation window, and finally push the content to the site with **Push**.</span>  

![](images/versioncontrol.png)    

<span style="color:green">Interesting to note: Occasionally, the commit will fail the first time, but succeed on a second attempt. Cursory reserach reveals that this is not an uncommon issue, but I have not yet uncovered the reason.</span>  

<span style="color:green">We can quickly browse the available references (see **Reference Links** in the **Initial Setup** section) to get an idea of what RMarkdown can do. A significant note here is that, while this is an HTML website, RMarkdown has several other output formats available including presentations, word processing and PDF documents, notebooks, and [interactive content](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-14.html). This last output is what I want to explore in today's Percolator session.</span>
